<h1>Fish Movement Visualizations</h1>
<p>A collection of data visualizations for exploring the movement of fish.</p>

<h4>Crossfilter</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="crossfilter.html">crossfilter.html</a>: Initial crossfilter using dc.js with bar charts for River, Year, Species, Section, Season, and Length.</li>
  <li><a href="crossfilter-scatter.html">crossfilter-scatter.html</a>: crossfilter.html with a brushable scatter plot of weight vs length (poor performance, too many points?)</li>
  <li><a href="crossfilter-stack-river.html">crossfilter-stack-river.html</a>: crossfilter.html with river bar chart stacked by species</li>
</ul>

<h4>Force Layout</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="force-mainstem-01.html">force-mainstem-01.html</a>: Force directed graph of fictious data moving between positions along a single crooked path</li>
  <li><a href="force-trib-01.html">force-trib-01.html</a>: Force directed graph of fictious data moving between positions along a linear path with a tributary branch</li>
</ul>

<h4>Parallel Coordinates</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="parallel-coord-time.html">parallel-coord-time.html</a>: Parallel coordinates of each individual fish moving between segments (y-axis) between seasons (y-axis) and colored by species</li>
  <li><a href="parallel-coord-season.html">parallel-coord-season.html</a>: Parallel coordinates of each individual fish moving between segments (y-axis) over time (x-axis) and colored by species</li>
</ul>
